          <h1> A little bit of history</h1>
          <p>Rock music first grew out of the rock’n’roll movement of the 1940s and 50s, which itself was inspired by country and African-American rhythm and blues from the 1920s and 30s. Even from its inception, rock music has been constantly evolving, and continuously creating subgenres that can be sourced from all over the world................ pretend like there is more smart things here, kinda lazy to look for more :/</p>

              <p><strong>The beatles</strong></p>
              <p>The Beatles are unquestionably the best and most important band in rock history. Almost miraculously, they embodied the apex of the form artistically, commercially and spiritually at just the right time, the tumultuous '60s, when music had the power to literally change the world...</p>

              <p><strong>Black sabbath</strong></p>
              <p>A metal institution whose influence cannot be overstated, Black Sabbath pioneered the genre as they constructed the framework for subsequent subgenres within metal, with entire movements rising from blueprints laid out in single Sabbath songs...</p>

             <p><strong>Pink floyd</strong></p>
             <p>Pink Floyd is the most eccentric and experimental multi-platinum band of the album rock era, creating exceptional cinematic sound sculptures “Meddle,” “Dark Side of the Moon,” “Wish You Were Here,” and the band’s popular apex and conceptual death knell, “The Wall.”...</p>

             <p><strong>the beatles: Abbey road</strong></p>
             <p>I'm listening to this album while working on this. Everyone knows how this album is important in Rock music history, and I can't agree less. It always gives me chills and makes me feel beautiful things. I wish that someday I will visit Abbey Road and take a picture crossing that street with someone who loves this album as much as I do.</p>

             <p><strong>Black sabbath: Heaven and hell</strong></p>
             <p>Okay, this might not be their greatest album of all time, but it's absolutly my favorite. It discusses the meaningless of life, and how confusing it can be, especialy in "heaven in hell" song. As normal human beings we don't really like to take reality as it is; well to me this album is one of the best introductions to this painful reality. </p>

             <p><strong>Pink floyd: the dark side of the moon</strong></p>
             <p> I actually can't find the words to describe my relationship with this masterpiece. Listening to this album is like going on a journey to learn about life...and death! Every song has something to teach you, and every solo is there to amaze you. This one is probably more of a religion and a bunch of beliefs to live on. So make your "time" worth it and go on this trip!  </p>
